  summary: The fastest feature-rich C++11/14/17/20 single-header testing framework for unit tests and TDD
  description: |
    doctest is a new C++ testing framework
    but is by far the fastest both in compile times (by orders of magnitude)
    and runtime compared to other feature-rich alternatives.
    It brings the ability of compiled languages such as D / Rust / Nim
    to have tests written directly in the production code thanks to a fast,
    transparent and flexible test runner with a clean interface.
